#+title: CODE EDITOR ALTERNATIVES
#+title: A PRACTICAL OVERVIEW WITH SPACEMACS

 [[./try_emacs.jpg]]

* Goals of this presentation

1. Why did I chose spacemacs?
2. How I build Clojure code with it?
3. Prove the most important sentence in the code editors world:
   - *Emacs >>>>>> Vim*
   - In fact, the best editor is a mix of Emacs and Vim
     - *This is SPACEMACS*

* Why Spacemacs?

- *Great Clojure integration*
  - Easy to integrate and setup a REPL
  - Many clojurists use emacs and variations
  - It was developed in ELISP, a dialect of lisp as clojure also is.
- *Mnemonics keybindings*
  - All commands make sense and it's easy to learn a new shortcut ‚å®Ô∏è
- *Vim keybindings*
  - The same commands you use on Vim, work on Spacemacs
- *Install it and start!*
  - You will spend more time on your code and less on your coding environment üíª.

* Great Clojure integration

It's easy to setup and start a clojure project. I'll show it in this presentation.

* Mnemonics keybindings

All key bindings are mnemonic and are organized under the *<Leader>* =SPC= key

[[./meme3.jpg]]

- /projects/ =SPC p=
  + /project list/ =SPC p l=
  + /project find/ =SPC p f=
- /search/ =SPC s=
- /help/ =SPC h=

 * *Don't try to memorize key bindings,*
   *but the commands!*
   *You can always use =SPC SPC= and discover the command you need.*

* Vim keybindings

You can run many commands using =:=, just like in vim

Example:
=SPC f s= | =:w=

* Install it and start!

- *Setup*
  - Emacs dot file!
- *Open a clojure file and start coding!*

* Finally

Thank you everyone!
